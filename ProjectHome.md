The Cortex project provides a set of high quality C++ libraries and Python modules tailored for software development in the visual effects industry. Rather than producing end user tools, the project focuses on creating a reusable set of modules of use to TDs and programmers in a broad range of scenarios - allowing them to focus on the more interesting or innovative aspects of development.

To learn more, take a look at the [Cortex presentations from SIGGRAPH 2011 ](http://vimeo.com/cortex), read a [short introduction to Cortex](http://cortex-vfx.googlecode.com/files/AnOpenSourceFrameworkForVisualEffectsSoftwareDevelopment.pdf), or dive straight into the [code examples](http://code.google.com/p/cortex-vfx/wiki/ExamplesIntroduction).
